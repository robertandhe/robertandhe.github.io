<p>You are given an integer array <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>.  From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps.  The (1st, 3rd, 5th, …) jumps in the series are called <em>odd numbered jumps</em>, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, …) jumps in the series are called <em>even numbered jumps</em>.</p>
